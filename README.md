# Archer's Island

Live site: (https://han-sen.github.io/archers-island/)[https://han-sen.github.io/archers-island/]

After a cataclysmic polar shift, the continents were ripped apart, making solid land a rare commodityâ€¦

Drifting for years, you come across an unclaimed island, but another archer swoops in to claim it!

A shootout contest begins! Reach 3 or more points to win! No ties, extra innings if necessary!

Press SHOOT to fire an arrow, press START to begin.
