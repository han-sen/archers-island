# Archer's Island

Live site: https://han-sen.github.io/archers-island/

After a cataclysmic polar shift, the continents were ripped apart, making solid land a rare commodityâ€¦

Drifting for years on your tiny rock, you come across an unclaimed island, but another archer swoops in to claim it!

A shootout contest begins! Reach 3 or more points to win! 

Press SHOOT to fire an arrow, press START to begin.

### About this project

This game was built using Javascript and HTML Canvas to paint and move the sprites on screen.

### Future plans

- Implementing quadratic easing to the player motion, to give a more dynamic 'bobbing' movement.

- Adding sprite animations.

- More dynamic obstacles, such as a metal 'sea junk' that will bounce the arrow back at the player.
